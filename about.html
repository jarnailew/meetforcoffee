  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <div id="abouttext">
    <p>Are you planning to hang out with your friends but sick of going to Starbucks or Costa Coffee every time you want a catch up? <br />
    We know the feeling. Let us help! </p>
    <p><span>meet for coffee</span> was set up by three coffee and coding aficionados to help Londoners find somewhere new to grab a latte. London is such a huge, bustling city and coffee culture is booming - there's never been a better time to get involved! </p>
    <p>So, the next time you're about to send off a <span>meet for coffee?</span> text to your group chat, visit our website and open your eyes to the great places to hang out in our beautiful city.
